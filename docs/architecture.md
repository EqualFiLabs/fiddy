# Statics Lottery Architecture

Statics Lottery is a standalone ERC-20 lottery implemented behind one
`StaticsLotteryDiamond` address. Governance creates immutable Round Configuration Versions, and
the first paid ticket purchase opens a Round by snapshotting one version and the current
integration version. Multiple Rounds may be active concurrently, including Rounds whose Payment
Tokens differ.

The Lottery does not modify the Statics protocol. STATICS, USDG, WETH, or another approved asset
is simply the ERC-20 Payment Token selected by a Round Configuration Version. Native ETH is never
ticket principal.

   |       |        |
   |       |        +---- exact same-token proceeds ----> OperatorFeeRouter
   |       +------------- exact ERC-20 custody ----------> Payment Token
   +--------------------- committed beacon reads --------> EqualFiDrandRegistry
            |
            +------------- pull Treasury delivery -------> Treasury recipient
```

The Lottery owns Round lifecycle and accounting. It deliberately delegates two concerns:

- `EqualFiDrandRegistry` verifies drand Quicknet proofs and caches canonical randomness. The
  Lottery contains no BLS or EIP-2537 implementation.
- `OperatorFeeRouter` applies Operator ownership, activation weight, forfeiture, reward-index, and
  claim rules. The Lottery records and forwards only a versioned same-token Operator share.

The Registry and Router are configured through append-only Integration Versions. A Round keeps
the version it opened with, so later governance changes cannot redirect that Round's randomness
or Operator liability.

## Single-address Diamond

All public Lottery calls use the Diamond address. The fallback looks up `msg.sig` in Diamond
storage and delegates to the selected facet. The initial production surface contains:

| Facet | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `DiamondCutFacet` | Authority-gated EIP-2535 add, replace, remove, and initializer execution |
| `DiamondLoupeFacet` | Facet and selector introspection |
| `GovernanceFacet` | Configuration versions, integration versions, roles, pause, concurrency, and finalization |
| `LotteryFacet` | Opening, exact ticket purchases, deadline scheduling and early sellout commitment |
| `SettlementFacet` | Registry consumption, winner derivation, and accounting-only settlement |
| `ClaimsFacet` | Pull-based winner and finalizer claims |
| `RevenueFacet` | Retryable Operator/Treasury delivery and canonical-token surplus handling |
| `LotteryViewFacet` | Round, configuration, ticket-range, and accounting reads |

No facet owns an independent balance or proxy. Delegatecalls operate on explicitly namespaced
Diamond storage.

## Storage model

The implementation uses stable `keccak256` namespace slots rather than a shared linear layout:

| Namespace | Contents |
|---|---|
| `statics.lottery.diamond.storage.v1` | selectors, facet indexes, authority, finalization latch |
| `statics.lottery.storage.game.v1` | configurations, Rounds, ticket ranges, refund credits, concurrency indexes |
| `statics.lottery.storage.integration.v1` | append-only Registry/Router versions |
| `statics.lottery.storage.accounting.v1` | per-token liabilities, versioned Operator buckets, finalizer credits, admitted tokens |
| `statics.lottery.storage.governance.v1` | guardian, Treasury recipient, pause state |
| `statics.lottery.storage.reentrancy.v1` | Diamond-wide value-path reentrancy state |

An upgrade must reuse these exact layouts or introduce a new namespace. Adding, reordering, or
retyping fields inside a live namespace is not safe merely because the facet compiles.

## Round lifecycle

```text
None -- first paid purchase --> Open -- early sellout --> SoldOut
                                 |                         |
                                 | deadline + beacon       | sellout beacon
                                 +-----------> Settled <---+
```

Opening requires an enabled immutable configuration, global capacity, no other nonterminal Round for that version, and current integrations. Nonzero Operator allocations additionally require a ready Router accepting the token.

Opening stores the first Registry beacon strictly after `expiresAt + randomnessDelay` and emits `RoundDrawScheduled`. Duration is configurable, including week-long Rounds; 24 hours is not a protocol maximum. Purchases record cumulative ownership ranges, actual receipts, and exact same-token escrow. No purchase refund credit is recorded.

The final ticket purchase before the deadline atomically records `selloutAt`, marks `SoldOut`, and deterministically supersedes the deadline schedule with the first beacon strictly after `selloutAt + randomnessDelay`. Invalid/cached targets revert the entire purchase. This is the only permitted rescheduling.

At or after `expiresAt`, an unsold Round rejects every purchase and becomes eligible for direct `settleRound` once the recorded beacon is available. Its stored status remains `Open` until settlement; callers must consider the deadline when displaying sales availability. No separate close transaction exists.

Both paths select among `soldTickets` and allocate actual receipts. One-ticket Rounds draw normally. No new Round can expire into refunds. Historical refund slots and the `Expired` enum ordinal remain reserved without reordering storage. New deployments omit `expireRound`, `claimRefund`, and `refundableAmount` selectors.

Settlement releases global capacity and the configuration's active-Round slot. A sold-out but unsettled Round continues occupying its slot.

## Settlement and exits

Settlement verifies or reuses only the Round's committed Registry beacon, derives one
domain-separated seed, resolves the winning sold ticket through cumulative ranges, and records the
result. It performs no Payment Token, winner, Treasury, or Router value transfer.

That separation is intentional. Token delivery and external Router availability cannot reverse or
block the Round's terminal state. Claims and revenue delivery are independent pull operations.
Each guarded value-moving path clears its liability before interaction and relies on atomic EVM
rollback if an external call or exact-delta check fails.

Pausing affects only `openRound` and `buyTickets`. It cannot prevent settlement,
winner claims, finalizer claims, Treasury delivery, Operator retries, surplus handling, or
views.

## Progressive immutability

Before finalization, the configured authority can add, replace, or remove selectors and can run an
initializer through delegatecall. Production governance is therefore expected to put the Lottery
authority behind an external timelock and review every selector and storage-layout change. The
Lottery contract itself does not implement that delay.

`finalizeProtocol` irreversibly sets `cutsDisabled`. Afterward every Diamond cut reverts and no
callable path can restore code mutability. Finalization does not remove ordinary configuration
governance: new immutable versions, enable flags, concurrency, roles, and pause controls remain
available for future Rounds. Existing Round snapshots and liabilities remain unchanged in either
case.

See [governance.md](governance.md) for the role model and the distinction between code
finalization and optional external governance renunciation.

## Chain trust boundary

drand removes application-level entropy selection by buyers, proof submitters, finalizers, and
ordinary configuration governance. It does not provide transaction inclusion or L2 timestamp
freshness. Statics Lottery assumes Robinhood Chain supplies canonical ordering, state availability,
and eventual inclusion according to its rules.

A sequencer that deliberately withholds or reorders the final purchase, or holds permitted L2 time
stale until a favorable public beacon exists, violates that accepted chain assumption. This is a
chain-level trust failure, not a capability the Lottery or drand can independently repair. See
[randomness.md](randomness.md) for the exact claim boundary.

## Historical testnet realization

The recorded deployment predates deadline draws and was finalized. It is not evidence for the new behavior, which requires a fresh Diamond and a separately authorized real-beacon rehearsal. Current scripts require `LOTTERY_DIAMOND` explicitly rather than targeting the historical address.

The disposable Robinhood Testnet release preserves the single-address architecture and records:

- reused-versus-fresh component provenance and explicit untested Genesis boundaries in
  [`robinhood-testnet.md`](robinhood-testnet.md);
- the Diamond, facets, selectors, code hashes, roles, integrations, and initial configurations in
  [`deployments/robinhood-testnet/lottery.json`](../deployments/robinhood-testnet/lottery.json);
- the Registry deployment and concrete EIP-2537 checks in
  [`deployments/robinhood-testnet/registry.json`](../deployments/robinhood-testnet/registry.json);
  and
- concurrent WETH/STATICS Rounds, live Quicknet settlement, refunds, claims, Router retries,
  upgrade storage preservation, and finalization in
  [`deployments/robinhood-testnet/lifecycle.json`](../deployments/robinhood-testnet/lifecycle.json).

Those addresses and roles are a bounded test rehearsal. They are not a production governance or
deployment recommendation.
