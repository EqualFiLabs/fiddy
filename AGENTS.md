## Project Identity and Boundaries

- The product is **Statics Lottery**. `fiddy` is the workspace/repository name,
  not the protocol's user-facing name.
- Treat `specs/requirements.md`, `specs/design.md`, and `specs/tasks.md` as the
  source-of-truth specification set. Keep them synchronized when an accepted
  product or architecture decision changes.
- Preserve the single-address `StaticsLotteryDiamond` architecture. Add or
  replace behavior through facets and namespaced Diamond storage; do not create
  per-round proxies, separate ticket contracts, or separate custody contracts
  without an explicit design change.
- `EqualFiDrandRegistry` is the external randomness-verification boundary. Do
  not duplicate BLS or drand verification inside the Lottery.
- `OperatorFeeRouter` is the external Operator-allocation boundary. The Lottery
  accounts for and forwards the configured Operator share; it does not maintain
  per-Operator ownership, multiplier, reward-index, or claim state.
- The Lottery must not depend on or modify the Statics Diamond. Treat STATICS as
  one possible configured ERC-20 Payment Token unless the user explicitly
  expands the integration scope.
- Do not modify sibling repositories or external deployments unless the user
  explicitly expands the scope. Inspect their live source and manifests when
  validating an integration assumption.

## Ethereum Skills

- Use the global `$security` and `$testing` skills before writing or changing
  production Solidity.
- Use `$addresses` when resolving standard protocol addresses. For EqualFi,
  Statics, drand, Router, and Payment Token deployments, verify the live source
  and deployment manifest; never guess an address.
- Use `$x-ray` when preparing the implementation for audit.
- Use `$audit` for the independent security review of a committed release
  candidate.
- Apply specialized skills proportionately. A narrow documentation or test-only
  change does not require rerunning unrelated expensive verification.
- Repository specifications, live source, deployment manifests, and this
  repository's invariants take precedence over generic skill guidance.

## Protocol Invariants

- Governance creates immutable Round Configuration Versions and controls which
  versions may open future rounds. Opening a round snapshots its configuration,
  including its Payment Token; later governance changes must not mutate an open
  round.
- Opening from an enabled configuration is permissionless under the specified
  lifecycle rules. The opener must not be able to override the configured token
  or economics.
- Multiple rounds may run concurrently, including rounds using different
  Payment Tokens. Enforce the global concurrency limit without coupling their
  custody or accounting.
- Native ETH is not ticket principal. Reject accidental native ETH transfers.
  WETH is an ordinary configurable ERC-20 Payment Token, not a privileged path.
- Keep all principal, proceeds, liabilities, fees, claims, and solvency checks
  scoped to the round's Payment Token. One token or round must never subsidize
  another.
- Support only exact-transfer, non-rebasing Payment Tokens. Verify both sender
  spend and recipient receipt balance deltas for inbound and outbound transfers;
  reject fee-on-transfer, sender-fee, rebasing, or otherwise inexact behavior.
- A sold-out round is final: it cannot be cancelled or refunded. It proceeds to
  the configured drand round and settlement.
- An expired unsold round refunds all ticket principal. No fee or revenue share
  is earned from a failed round.
- There is no fallback randomness. A sold-out round waits for the committed
  drand round and must not switch providers, use a later round, or derive local
  entropy.
- Settlement is accounting-only. It records the winner and token-denominated
  claim liabilities without calling the Payment Token or requiring winner
  delivery, Treasury delivery, Operator Router availability, or claimant
  cooperation in the settlement transaction.
- Claims and revenue delivery are pull-based and independently retryable. A
  failed recipient or Router interaction must not reverse settlement or block
  unrelated claims.
- Pausing may stop new exposure, but must not prevent refunds, winner claims,
  Treasury claims, Operator funding retries, or other liability-reducing exits.
- Forward the Operator share in the same Payment Token directly to the
  configured `OperatorFeeRouter`. Do not silently swap tokens, wrap native ETH,
  or reproduce Router distribution state inside the Lottery.
- Diamond upgrades remain governed and timelocked until irreversible
  finalization. Finalization disables future Diamond cuts; it must not silently
  remove separate configuration-governance powers unless the specification says
  so explicitly.

## Naming Constraint

- Do not use workflow placeholders such as `Task`, `Task 1`, `Task (n)`, or
  similar labels in filenames, contract names, function names, test names, or
  commit messages.
- Numbered implementation checklists are allowed inside `specs/tasks.md`, but
  production and test vocabulary must describe the behavior being delivered.

## Solidity Guidance

- Preserve Diamond storage compatibility, facet selector manifests, and the
  single-address external surface when changing production contracts.
- Use explicit namespaced storage layouts and review every storage-layout or
  selector change for collision and upgrade safety.
- Follow checks-effects-interactions, use reentrancy protection on value-moving
  paths, and record claim liabilities before external calls. Rely on atomic
  rollback when an exact-transfer verification fails.
- Use `SafeERC20`-style calls together with explicit balance-delta validation;
  a successful ERC-20 return value alone is insufficient for exact accounting.
- Prefer custom errors and behavior-specific events. Events must include enough
  round, configuration, token, and amount context to reconstruct accounting.
- Do not change a production ABI width merely to work around a compiler or test
  harness issue when compatibility matters.
- Do not hard-code an address from a discussion, stale document, or unverified
  deployment note. Verify the intended chain and current deployment source.

## Compiling and Testing

- Do not use `forge build --force`, `forge build --contracts`, or `forge clean`
  as routine commands. They discard useful cache state and can make parallel
  work interfere with itself.
- Prefer focused commands such as `forge test --match-path <path>` while
  iterating, then run the complete applicable release gate on the committed
  candidate.
- Every production behavior change must include tests at the narrowest useful
  level and integration coverage for each affected value-moving lifecycle.
- Do not enable global `via_ir`, change the optimizer policy, or change the EVM
  target merely to make one file compile. Use a narrowly scoped exception only
  when necessary and document why.
- Before any RPC, fork, deployment, or live-chain check, load the operator's
  canonical private RPC environment in the same shell. Use
  `ROBINHOOD_MAINNET` or `ROBINHOOD_TESTNET` for Robinhood and never print or
  commit RPC values. Report skipped or unavailable live validation separately
  from passed local tests.
- Match validation cost to the changed behavior. Do not rerun expensive formal
  verification when the changed property is outside the model; use focused
  regression evidence and state the proof boundary accurately.

## Test Fidelity Guardrails

- Use unit harnesses for narrow branches, storage transitions, and states that
  are otherwise unreachable. Do not present harness-only evidence as proof of a
  real end-to-end flow.
- Cover each value-moving lifecycle with real ERC-20 approvals, transfers,
  balance changes, claims, and exact-delta assertions.
- Test concurrent rounds with different Payment Tokens and prove that settlement,
  refunds, fees, and excess-balance handling remain isolated by token and round.
- Include adversarial token tests for receiver fees, sender fees, rebasing or
  balance drift, unusual return values, and reentrant callbacks where applicable.
- Use the real `OperatorFeeRouter` and `EqualFiDrandRegistry` interfaces in
  integration tests. Mocks may cover narrow failure branches, but they do not
  establish compatibility with live deployments.
- Final testnet validation must use an actual committed drand Quicknet round and
  exercise delayed settlement, winner claims, Treasury claims, Operator Router
  funding, and unsold-round refunds.
- Fuzz and invariant tests broaden state-space coverage; they supplement rather
  than replace real lifecycle tests.
- Synthetic balance injection, direct storage mutation, and shortcut minting
  must be narrow, documented, and excluded from end-to-end confidence claims.

## Commit Discipline

- Keep commits narrow, reviewable, and independently valid. Stage explicit paths
  so unrelated dirty or untracked files are never swept into the commit.
- Use a Conventional Commit title of 72 characters or fewer. Do not mention
  workflow task numbers in the title or body.
- Use present-tense body bullets that explain what changed and why. Separate
  specification, implementation, validation, and remediation slices when that
  improves reviewability.
- Before pushing, opening a PR, or changing an external repository, confirm the
  exact `OWNER/REPO` and authorization. Never infer repository ownership from
  credentials, a checkout path, or a remote already present on the machine.
- When handing work back, include the proposed or used commit message in a fenced
  block and distinguish focused local checks from unrun, remote, fork, formal,
  or live-deployment validation.

## Compiler Resilience for Test Harnesses

- For external or public test helper and fuzz entry-point numeric parameters,
  prefer `uint256`, bound the value, then cast to the narrower production type.
  This reduces stack pressure without changing the production ABI.
- Keep helpers small and behavior-specific. If a test needs unusual compiler
  settings or synthetic setup, isolate and explain the exception rather than
  weakening repository-wide settings or production interfaces.
